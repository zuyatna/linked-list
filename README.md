# Linked List
<br>
<p>A linked list is a collection of values arranged in a linear, unidirectional sequence. A linked list has several theoretical advantages over contiguous storage options such as the Kotlin Array or ArrayList:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Constant time insertion and removal from the front of the list.</li>
  <li>Reliable performance characteristics.</li>
</ul>
